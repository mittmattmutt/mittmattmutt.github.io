# The culture wars: a simple linguistic misunderstanding?

Consider these claims:

* Speech is violence
* Science is biased
* Knowledge is perspectival
* Reality is socially constructed

According to the sorts of thing one reads, these claims are the subject of a
culture war between those who hold them and those who oppose them in favour of
free speech, scientific progress, objective knowledge and human-independent
reality. It’s a deep battle between on the one hand postmodernist inspired
feminists, critical race theorists et al. and on the other the children and
legacy bearers of the Enlightenment.

I doubt I’m the first person to suggest this but: couldn’t this all be a simple
misunderstanding? Maybe there are different ways of reading these sentences
according to one of which they are true while according to the other they are
false. In order to investigate this, let’s consider what linguistics might have
to say about those sentences. As we’ll see, it has rather a lot of suggestive
things to say.

#### Generics

The above sentences are generalizations. As it happens, language provides us
with a variety of means of generalizing: of talking about how things stand
generally with a chunk of reality. Here are some:

* All ducks are animals
* Every chip is made from potato
* Most chairs have a cushion
* Many books have over 200 pages
* 40% of people flunk out of basic army training
* Some colours are bright

Philosophers call expressions like ‘All ducks’ and ‘Every chip’ quantifiers,
because they say *how much* or *many* of certain type of thing are a certain
type of way. Quantifiers are pretty well understood by logicians, linguists, and
philosophers of language (they present intriguing problems of their own, but
that’s not for this post.)

But there is another way of generalizing without specifying exactly how much of
a certain thing is the way you’re saying. Thus consider:

* Prime numbers are divisible by themselves and one
* Ducks lay eggs
* Mosquitoes carry West Nile virus

And:

* Gold is shiny
* Water is potable
* Laughter is infectious

These seem also to be generalizing, but they don’t even vaguely specify a
quantity. Moreover, they differ in strengths: as we go down the list, the number
or amount of the object or stuff with the property varies: thus all prime
numbers are divisible by themselves and one, but only about 50% of ducks lay
eggs (because only female ducks lay eggs), and very few mosquitoes actually
carry the virus.

Similarly, while — let’s assume — almost all gold is shiny, a lot of water (sea
water, for example) isn’t potable, and oftentimes laughter isn’t infectious (as
you’ll know only too well if you’ve ever sat someone down to watch your
favourite youtube video only to be met with an agonizing stony silence).

It seems that these sorts of expressions, which are (roughly) what linguists
call *generics*, are weird. They bear different strengths, but the same
linguistic form. That could get confusing, right?

#### That does indeed get confusing.

Consider these two perspectives on the world. On the one, we look out at the
world, survey how it is, and describe what we survey by saying something. On
one, we hear somebody say something, and on the basis imagine what the world
must be like.

You would expect these two perspectives to harmonize. We look out at the world,
see there’s a dog on the floor, and describe that by saying ‘there’s a dog on
the floor’. Or we hear someone say ‘there’s a dog on the floor’ and come to
imagine the dog on the floor. In these cases, what we see in the first
perspective is pretty much what we imagine in the second perspective.

With generics, a study suggests, things go badly wrong (the study is Cimpian,
Brandone, and Gelman available
[here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2992340/). I owe this
reference, and the idea of this post, to Herman Cappelen and Josh Dever’s
forthcoming book *Bad Language *(chapter 8), which discusses this study and more
generally the possible socially deleterious effects of generics. For more on
generics, see the [Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/generics/#GeneSterPrej)).

Remember the important fact that generics differ in their strength. It turns out
this variable strength causes the two perspectives mentioned above to
deharmonize. In particular, say we look out at the world and see 70% of K’s are
G: we see 70% of cats drink milk, say. On that basis, we are happy to conclude
‘cats drink milk’.

If generics were harmonious, then from the perspective of hearing and imagining
the world, we would expect that if we heard ‘cats drink milk’, we would imagine
70% of cats drink milk. *We don’t do that*. Instead, we conclude many more cats
like milk — around 96%. Here’s the crucial point: *we utter generics on much
weaker evidence than we accept them*.

#### So?

Here’s a hypothesis: something like this explains the wars over sentences like
the ones we started with. Here’s how it could go: a liberal witnesses some
instances of speech being violent, science being biased, knowledge being
perspectival, or reality being socially constructed.

On that basis, they conclude the generic in question. The opponent then hears
them say it, and on that basis, they conclude that the liberal thinks pretty
much all speech (science/etc.) is violence (/biased, etc.) The opponent
disagrees, and the argument starts, and goes on and on and on.

On this understanding, though, neither is really doing anything wrong. It’s just
this weird, tricky, and unexpected feature of generic claims that they have this
asymmetry. Were the two parties to the debate to realize this, perhaps, the
debate would either vanish, or at least could proceed on much more solid ground.
The opponent could concede that some speech is violence, while the liberal could
concede that not all speech is violence, and then the task could be to meet in
the middle and work out exactly how much speech is violence, away from the
potentially misleading effects of the generics in which these debates tend to be
framed. While they’d probably still have much to disagree about, it seems that
the debate could move on more profitably.
