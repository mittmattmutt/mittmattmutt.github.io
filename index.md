This is the blog of Matthew McKeever ([@mittmattmutt](https://twitter.com/@mittmattmutt)). I am an academic philosopher and writer. My academic work is here: [mipmckeever.weebly.com](https://mipmckeever.weebly.com). You can read a sample of my debut work of fiction, a philsophical novella called 'Coming From Nothing' (Zero Books) [here](http://bit.ly/cfnextract). You can download and read *Before The Internet*, a book about 90s book culture I wrote [here](http://bit.ly/90sbook). Sign up to my [tinyletter](https://tinyletter.com/mittmattmutt) and I'll send (max once a week) shorter whole posts or parts of longer ones with links to the rest.
